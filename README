Veusz 1.24
----------
http://home.gna.org/veusz/

Veusz is a scientific plotting package.  It is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript, PDF or SVG output. Graphs are built-up
by combining plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple,
consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 1.24:
 * Text labels can now include Python expressions inside %{{ }}%
 * Added built-in functions DATE([fmt]), TIME([fmt]), FILENAME() and BASENAME()
   when evaluating expressions, which are useful when used in labels
 * Added Python dictionary ENVIRON when evaluating expressions, to obtain
   values from environment variables
 * Added DATA(name, [part]) function to expression environment for accessing
   values from datasets, useful for function evaluation or labels
 * Added SETTING(path) function for expression evaluation to obtain values
   of settings
 * Added ESCAPE(text) function to environment, which allows LaTeX special
   characters to be displayed in labels
 * Add fractions and percentages units to polar plot
 * Allow number of spokes to be varied in polar plot
 * Widgets can be clicked holding down shift or ctrl, to add or toggle their
   selection
 * Add K. Moreland's cool-warm colormap (thanks to S. Richardson)
 * Added further green-map, blue-darkred, blue-darkorange, brown-blue and
   blue-orange colormaps from Oregon geography dept.
 * Add logarithm and exponential dataset plugins
 * Add Wipe() command to embedding interface to clear document
 * Add File->Reload menu option to reload from saved document
 * Add tooltip to items in FieldWidget showing widget path

Bux fixes:
 * Fix transparency with bar plot
 * Use getcwdu() for python2 to avoid bugs combining paths
 * Handle inf/nan when converting to human readable form in plots
 * Fix CreateHistogram on command line without binparams parameter
 * Handle empty 2D dataset import with grid at edge enabled
 * Do not allow error bars on imported CSV non-numeric data
 * Handle missing argument in \size
 * For data edit dialog, allow 1D dataset to replace 2D dataset
 * Crash if zoom to be height when height is zero
 * Fix problem with 2D import if error message is in unicode
 * With axis-function widget catch result if greater than 1 dimension
 * Fix cloning for datasets with / in name
 * Fix crash in embedding if plot window closed while rendering in progress
