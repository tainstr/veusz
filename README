Veusz 1.25
----------
http://home.gna.org/veusz/

Veusz is a scientific plotting package.  It is designed to produce
publication-ready Postscript, PDF or SVG output. Graphs are built-up
by combining plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple,
consistent and powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Changes in 1.25:
 * Add n-dimensional dataset support
 * Add GetColormap command to return RGBA values
 * Add Colormap sequence plugin for choosing colors of widgets
 * Fill above/below setting shown in key for xy widget
 * Add Covariance widget for plotting covariance ellipses
 * Add lineup, linedown, lineleft and lineright markers
 * Add lineup, linedown and lineextend arrows

Bug fixes:
 * Fix pick indices if non-finite values in data
 * Fix drag and drop of files into Veusz on Windows
 * Raise exception if functions in console request input, avoiding hang
 * Initialise unsafe_mode, in case Veusz used in PyQt embedding
 * Fix crash if setting default setting in default setting window
 * Fix crash in Clone() command on python3
